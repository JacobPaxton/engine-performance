Since I only have 53 dyno tests, I have to be careful with how I approach this problem. I could look at each car's max horsepower as an observation and create features for boost PSI levels, gas octane levels, stages, etc. I could also look at max torque, or other maximums. \n",

    "### Understanding the data\n",
    "1. RPM: Revolutions Per Minute, referring to how many times the camshaft spins in a minute. Independent variable.\n",
    "2. HP: Horsepower, referring to the power output of the engine, likely calculated at the wheels (WHP). Dependent.\n",
    "3. Torque: refers to the ability of the engine to overcome resistance, in lb/sqft. Dependent.\n",
    "4. AFR: Air-Fuel Ratio, refers to how lean the engine is running (higher number = more lean). Independent (you may consider this dependent, but the issue is that you can tune the car to run more lean or more rich).\n",
    "5. Boost: refers to the additional air pressure in PSI from a turbo. Independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision\n",
    "For the initial analysis, I will look at max horsepower as an observation. I'll add features that capture the different specifications of each car, then perform statistical analysis on those features against horsepower. Later, I may look at max torque (would be fairly easy to swap with max horsepower as a variable). I could look into area-under-curve analysis for horsepower and torque to see which cars have best performance through the entire cycle, but I'd need to be careful with cars having a wider RPM spread (torque and HP held even, a car with wider RPM spread will have larger area under curve)."
